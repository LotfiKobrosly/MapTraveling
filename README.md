# Map Traveling
This repo contains a simplified map traveling structure with a randomly generated map with obstacles, as start point and a goal. The objective is to implement a continuous version of *Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA)* and its variations. Then we would like to compare the performance to that of a *Rapid Action Value Evaluation (RAVE)* and its generalized version *GRAVE*.
